# Release Rentention Exercise

Base on the requirements of the project, I have decided to use (tsdx)[https://tsdx.io/] to build a simple headless React component


## Commands

### Setup project
```
yarn install
```
### Start up a dev build

```
yarn start
```

### Run test
** Project is set up with Enzyme and Axe-core for unit test and accessibility test ** 
```
yarn test
```

## Run example
** Example when using the component with mockData and without any styling ** 
```
cd example && yarn
yarn start
```
